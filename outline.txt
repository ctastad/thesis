Introduction
- the challenge: field of bio has ever increasing issues in data management and doesn't apply tech solutions very effectively
    - ability to move past code to data manipulation and presentation
    - deployment and the integration of common programming practices
- the tech has evolved
    - transitioning (implementing) existing solutions with new paradigms
    - improved data management (manipulation, collation, visualization)
    - web front-end tech (web dev)
    - technologies that enable reformed development
        - javascript
        - markdown
        - rstudio engine
    - increased accessibility to non-tech users
- applications of the tech in bio, specifically the CCGD
    - gene screens in cancer bio

Methods
- project requirements
    - upgrade existing server build to RHEL 7
    - rewrite web interface in R knitr/markdown framework
    - rewrite central table construction process in Rshiny framework
    - implement ability to manipulate table by product owner (tim)
    - employ improved software development best practices
- datatables server-side javascript library
- rmarkdown site structure
- rshiny table app
- standard RHEL setup
- scripts in bash

Results
- code base reduced
- interface improved
- need for sql database eliminated
- space constraints eliminated. server resource reqs reduced overall.
- server admin and app controls streamlined
    - site render newly automated
