  abstract = {Identification of cancer driver gene mutations is crucial for advancing cancer therapeutics. Due to the overwhelming number of passenger mutations in the human tumor genome, it is difficult to pinpoint causative driver genes. Using transposon mutagenesis in mice many laboratories have conducted forward genetic screens and identified thousands of candidate driver genes that are highly relevant to human cancer. Unfortunately, this information is difficult to access and utilize because it is scattered across multiple publications using different mouse genome builds and strength metrics. To improve access to these findings and facilitate meta-analyses, we developed the Candidate Cancer Gene Database (CCGD, http://ccgd-starrlab.oit.umn.edu/). The CCGD is a manually curated database containing a unified description of all identified candidate driver genes and the genomic location of transposon common insertion sites (CISs) from all currently published transposon-based screens. To demonstrate relevance to human cancer, we performed a modified gene set enrichment analysis using KEGG pathways and show that human cancer pathways are highly enriched in the database. We also used hierarchical clustering to identify pathways enriched in blood cancers compared to solid cancers. The CCGD is a novel resource available to scientists interested in the identification of genetic drivers of cancer.},

  abstract = {The 2020 Nucleic Acids Research Database Issue contains 148 papers spanning molecular biology. They include 59 papers reporting on new databases and 79 covering recent changes to resources previously published in the issue. A further ten papers are updates on databases most recently published elsewhere. This issue contains three breakthrough articles: AntiBodies Chemically Defined (ABCD) curates antibody sequences and their cognate antigens; SCOP returns with a new schema and breaks away from a purely hierarchical structure; while the new Alliance of Genome Resources brings together a number of Model Organism databases to pool knowledge and tools. Major returning nucleic acid databases include miRDB and miRTarBase. Databases for protein sequence analysis include CDD, DisProt and ELM, alongside no fewer than four newcomers covering proteins involved in liquid–liquid phase separation. In metabolism and signaling, Pathway Commons, Reactome and Metabolights all contribute papers. PATRIC and MicroScope update in microbial genomes while human and model organism genomics resources include Ensembl, Ensembl genomes and UCSC Genome Browser. Immune-related proteins are covered by updates from IPD-IMGT/HLA and AFND, as well as newcomers VDJbase and OGRDB. Drug design is catered for by updates from the IUPHAR/BPS Guide to Pharmacology and the Therapeutic Target Database. The entire Database Issue is freely available online on the Nucleic Acids Research website (https://academic.oup.com/nar). The NAR online Molecular Biology Database Collection has been revised, updating 305 entries, adding 65 new resources and eliminating 125 discontinued URLs; so bringing the current total to 1637 databases.

  abstract = {On the advent of a completely assembled human genome, modern biology and molecular medicine stepped into an era of increasingly rich sequence database information and high-throughput genomic analysis. However, as sequence entries in the major genomic databases currently rise exponentially, the gap between available, deposited sequence data and analysis by means of conventional molecular biology is rapidly widening, making new approaches of high-throughput genomic analysis necessary. At present, the only effective way to keep abreast of the dramatic increase in sequence and related information is to apply biocomputational approaches. Thus, over recent years, the field of bioinformatics has rapidly developed into an essential aid for genomic data analysis and powerful bioinformatics tools have been developed, many of them publicly available through the World Wide Web. In this review, we summarize and describe the basic bioinformatics tools for genomic research such as: genomic databases, genome browsers, tools for sequence alignment, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) databases, tools for ab initio gene prediction, expression databases, and algorithms for promoter prediction.},

However there is very little evidence that sound software engineering practices are being applied to bioinformatics software development. As bioinformatics is a merging of the disciplines of biology and computer science, it would appear very odd that this, particularly important aspect of the computer science field would be absent, however that is the case. This paper will attempt to go into the reasons for this, as well as propositions that others have put forward to remedy this issue. We finally propose an approach towards resolving the software / requirement engineering challenges by comparing four methodologies Agile, SSADM, UP and Domain Engineering, and select the best approach that can help resolve the software / requirement engineering issues while developing bioinformatics software.},
